## Myself
I am a PhD student at Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The research topic is 'Modeling and simulation of turbulent free surface flows around ships and floating structures'. In the work I explore moving mesh and fixed grid techniques along with FSI(fluid structure interaction) coupling algorithms. Discontinuous Galerkin(DG) methods are explored for the numerical solution of advection equation encountered in fixed grid framework. Variational Multi Scale methods is used for turbulence modeling. Finite element method is used to numerically solve the coupled PDEs. Production level parallel (MPI based)C++ codes are developed in deal.ii(Differential Equations Analysis Library) framework and are shown to scale to thousands of processors.

## Background
I completed my dual degree in Civil Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2008. My area of interests are Numerical methods and High performance computing.
